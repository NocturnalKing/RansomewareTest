# RansomewareTest

This is a simple ransomware test program I made using the help of one of NetworkChuck's Youtube tutorial. The main program will encrypt or decrypt any file in the directory that it is in (excluding itself).
Do not use this for illegeal or nefarious purpouses, I made this program with the intention of learing how to use the cryptography.fernet library
